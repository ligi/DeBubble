DeBubble is a game where humans from different bubbles meet and have fun arguing

Goal of the game is to argue with someone who lives in a different bubble and earn points with it.
You get points for "no swear words" - "no LOUD VOICE" - "got the last word" - and long chains of arumentation. Also other players can rate your argumentation in certain categories like "friendlyness", "smartness", "acknowledgement of one's faults", "fun-factor" and so on.

There will be a leaderboard and achievements. 

was just trying something out - [threads could look like this PoC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAWPDTQos0A&google_comment_id=z13wv1moxqumdhlwk04cd11z5yjzj34b2as)

I imagine a flow like this:

in the first screen you choose a player type ( Judge, Word-Warrior and Battlefield-Scout )

as a judge you can view battles and then you can rate them in the categories mentioned above. You also see if battles progressed after you judged.

as a word warrior you first see a selection of controversial videos - then you can figth a word-battle with someone from another bubble on youtube. You can also mark battles as finished.

As lead finder you find controversial videos on youtube which would be good to fight a word-battle on.

All roles can view the leaderboard

The game will use the Youtube API and the Google play games API. The game will be for Android only first - but if someone wants to do a web or iOS version - feel free to do so!
